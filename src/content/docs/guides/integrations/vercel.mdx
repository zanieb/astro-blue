## Quick Deploy

Create `vercel.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "bun run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "astro"
}
```

## Environment Variables

Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
vercel env add MY_VARIABLE
```

## Preview Deployments

Every pull request gets a preview deployment automatically.

## Custom Domain

1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS as instructed

## Build Output

Astro Blue produces static output by default, perfect for Vercel's edge network.
