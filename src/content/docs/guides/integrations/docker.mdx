Containerize your documentation site for consistent deployments.

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json bun.lock ./
RUN npm install -g bun && bun install

COPY . .
RUN bun run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

## Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t my-docs .
```

## Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 my-docs
```

Your docs will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  docs:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
```

```bash
