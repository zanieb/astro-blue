description: Demo of various link styles including inline, external, internal, and links in different contexts.
---

This page demonstrates different link styles and their usage throughout documentation.

## Inline Links in Paragraphs

Links can appear naturally within flowing text. For example, you might want to reference the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/) when discussing the framework, or mention that this theme is built on [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for documentation sites. Multiple links can appear in a single paragraph, like when explaining that you can use [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components within Astro.

Here's another paragraph with an inline link to demonstrate link styling in the middle of a sentence. The [quick brown fox](https://example.com) jumps over the lazy dog, showing how links integrate with surrounding text.

## External Links

External links point to resources outside this documentation:

- [Astro Official Website](https://astro.build/) — The main Astro project site
- [Starlight Documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/) — The documentation framework this theme extends
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) — Where the source code is hosted
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) — Comprehensive web development reference
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/) — Official TypeScript documentation

## Internal Links

Internal links navigate between pages within this documentation:

- [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation/) — How to install and set up the theme
- [Configuration Reference](/reference/configuration/) — Complete configuration options
- [Components Overview](/concepts/components/) — Available components
- [Customization Guide](/guides/customization/) — How to customize the theme
- [Code Blocks](/concepts/code-blocks/) — Syntax highlighting and code examples
- [Lists Demo](/concepts/lists/) — Various list styles

You can also link to specific sections using anchors, like the [External Links](#external-links) section above.

## Links in Bulleted Lists

Simple list with links:

- Visit the [home page](/) to get started
- Check out [Asides](/concepts/asides/) for callout examples
- Learn about [Tabs](/concepts/tabs/) for tabbed content
- Explore [Cards](/concepts/cards/) for card layouts
- Review [Steps](/concepts/steps/) for step-by-step instructions

Mixed content with links:

- **Getting Started** — Read the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation/) first
- **Configuration** — Set up your [astro.config.mjs](/reference/configuration/) file
- **Components** — Use [Starlight components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/) in your content
- **Deployment** — Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

## Links in Numbered Lists

Step-by-step process with links:

1. Read the [prerequisites](/getting-started/installation/) before starting
2. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
3. Follow the [configuration guide](/reference/configuration/) to set up your project
4. Add content using [MDX syntax](https://mdxjs.com/)
5. Deploy using the [Astro deployment guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/)

Tutorial-style with inline links:

1. First, install the dependencies. Refer to the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) if you need help with package management.
2. Next, configure your project. The [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/) has all available options.
3. Add your first page. See the [content authoring guide](/guides/customization/) for tips.
4. Preview locally. The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/) provides development tools.
5. Deploy your site. Check the [deployment section](/getting-started/installation/) for hosting options.

## Links in Headings

### Visit [Astro Build](https://astro.build/) for More Info

The heading above contains a link. This can be useful for linking to relevant resources directly from section titles.

### Learn About [Components](/concepts/components/)

Internal links in headings help readers navigate to related documentation sections.

## Links with Code Text

Sometimes you need to link code elements:

- Install the [`@astrojs/starlight`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/starlight) package
- Configure [`astro.config.mjs`](/reference/configuration/) for your project
- Use the [`<Card>`](https://starlight.astro.build/components/cards/) component for layouts
- Import from [`astro:content`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) for collections
- Run [`npm run dev`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-run-script) to start the server

Inline code links in a paragraph: You can configure the [`sidebar`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#sidebar) option in your config, use the [`defineConfig`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/) helper, and import components from [`@astrojs/starlight/components`](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/).

## Nested Lists with Links

Complex nested structures with links:

- Documentation Resources
  - [Official Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)
  - [Starlight Guide](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/)
  - [MDX Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/docs/)
- Component Libraries
  - [Starlight Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/)
    - [Cards](https://starlight.astro.build/components/cards/)
    - [Tabs](https://starlight.astro.build/components/tabs/)
    - [Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/)
  - [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/)
- Deployment Platforms
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
  - [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
  - [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

## Multiple Links in One Line

Here are several links together: [Home](/) | [Docs](/concepts/components/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/) | [Discord](https://discord.com/)

Links separated by text: Go to [Astro](https://astro.build/), then to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), and finally to [this theme](/).

## Long Link Text

Sometimes links have longer descriptive text:

- [Read the complete guide to configuring your Astro project with Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/)
- [Learn how to customize the theme colors and typography in your documentation site](/guides/customization/)
- [Explore all available components and their configuration options](/concepts/components/)
