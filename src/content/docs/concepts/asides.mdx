import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Callout from '../../../components/Callout.astro';

Asides (also called admonitions or callouts) highlight important information. We provide two styles: the standard Starlight `Aside` and a Mintlify-style `Callout`.

## Callout (Mintlify Style)

The `Callout` component provides a clean, minimal style with just an icon and content - no title text.

<Callout>
  This is a note. It provides additional context that might be helpful.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  Pro tip: Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate faster.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when modifying configuration files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
  This action cannot be undone. Make sure you have a backup.
</Callout>

```mdx
import Callout from '../../../components/Callout.astro';

<Callout>This is a note.</Callout>
<Callout type="tip">This is a tip.</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">Be careful!</Callout>
<Callout type="danger">This is dangerous!</Callout>
```

## Multi-Line Callouts

Callouts can contain multiple paragraphs and rich content for longer explanations:

<Callout>
  This is the first paragraph of a multi-line callout. It provides an introduction to the topic at hand.

  The second paragraph goes into more detail about the subject matter. You can include as many paragraphs as needed to fully explain the concept.

  Finally, a third paragraph wraps up the explanation with any additional context or next steps.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro tip:** When building documentation sites, consider your audience carefully.

  Different users have different needs. Beginners need step-by-step guidance, while experienced users prefer quick reference material. Structure your docs to serve both.

  Use headings, callouts, and code examples to break up long sections and make content scannable.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Before making changes to production, always back up your data.

  This includes database exports, configuration files, and any user-generated content. Store backups in a secure, off-site location.

  Test your restoration process regularly to ensure backups are valid and complete.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
  **Critical warning:** This operation will permanently delete all data.

  Once executed, there is no way to recover the deleted information. This action affects all users and cannot be reversed.

  Before proceeding:
  - Ensure you have a complete backup
  - Notify all affected users
  - Confirm you have the necessary permissions
  - Double-check that you're operating on the correct environment
</Callout>
