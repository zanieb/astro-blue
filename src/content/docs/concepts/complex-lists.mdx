import Callout from '../../../components/Callout.astro';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This page demonstrates how complex content renders inside nested list items. This is useful for testing whether code blocks, callouts, and other rich content work correctly within list structures.

## Code Blocks in List Items

Lists can contain inline code and full code blocks:

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install @astrojs/starlight
  ```

- Configure your project:

  ```js
  // astro.config.mjs
  import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

  export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [starlight({ title: 'My Docs' })],
  });
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Nested Lists with Code Blocks

Multiple levels of nesting with code:

1. First step - set up your environment
   - Install Node.js (v18 or higher)
   - Install your preferred package manager:
     ```bash
     npm install -g pnpm
     ```
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     pnpm --version
     ```

2. Second step - create your project
   - Run the create command:
     ```bash
     pnpm create astro@latest --template starlight
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-docs
     ```

3. Third step - customize your theme
   - Edit the configuration file
   - Add your custom CSS

## Callouts in List Items

Lists can include callout components for highlighting important information:

- Basic setup is straightforward

  <Callout>
    Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed before proceeding.
  </Callout>

- Configure authentication

  <Callout type="warning">
    Never commit API keys or secrets to version control.
  </Callout>

- Deploy your application

  <Callout type="tip">
    Use environment variables for configuration that varies between environments.
  </Callout>

## Asides in List Items

Using the standard Aside component in lists:

1. Read the documentation first

   <Aside>
     The official documentation is available at docs.astro.build
   </Aside>

2. Be careful with breaking changes

   <Aside type="caution">
     Always check the changelog before upgrading major versions.
   </Aside>

3. Test thoroughly before deploying

   <Aside type="danger">
     Production deployments should always go through staging first.
   </Aside>

## Mixed Complex Content

Combining multiple content types in deeply nested lists:

- **Getting Started**
  - Prerequisites
    - Node.js v18+
    - A code editor like VS Code

      <Callout type="tip">
        VS Code has excellent Astro extension support.
      </Callout>

  - Installation steps:
    1. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/example/docs.git
       ```
    2. Install dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
    3. Start developing:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

- **Configuration**
  - Basic settings in `astro.config.mjs`
  - Theme customization in `src/styles/`

    <Callout type="warning">
      Custom styles may override theme defaults. Test thoroughly.
    </Callout>

## Tables in List Items

Lists can also contain tables:

- Supported languages:

  | Language | Extension | Highlighting |
  |----------|-----------|--------------|
  | JavaScript | `.js` | Yes |
  | TypeScript | `.ts` | Yes |
  | Python | `.py` | Yes |
  | Rust | `.rs` | Yes |

- File structure overview:

  | Directory | Purpose |
  |-----------|---------|
  | `src/content/` | Documentation content |
  | `src/components/` | Custom components |
  | `public/` | Static assets |

## Blockquotes in List Items

Lists can include blockquotes:

- User testimonials:

  > "This documentation theme is incredibly easy to use and looks great!"
  >
  > — Happy Developer

- From the official docs:

  > Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites.

## Long-Form Content in Lists

Sometimes list items need to contain longer explanations:

1. **Understanding the build process**

   When you run `npm run build`, Astro performs several steps. First, it compiles all your Markdown and MDX files into static HTML. Then, it processes your CSS and bundles any client-side JavaScript. Finally, it generates a sitemap and optimizes images.

   The entire process is designed to produce the smallest possible output while maintaining excellent performance scores.

2. **Configuring for production**

   Production builds require additional configuration. You need to set the correct `site` URL in your Astro config, enable any production-only features like analytics, and ensure environment variables are properly set.

   <Callout type="warning">
     Remember to test your production build locally using `npm run preview` before deploying.
   </Callout>

3. **Deployment options**

   Astro sites can be deployed to virtually any static hosting provider. Popular options include Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, and GitHub Pages. Each has its own configuration requirements.

   ```bash
   # Example: Deploy to Vercel
   npx vercel
   ```
