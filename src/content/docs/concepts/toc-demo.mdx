title: Table of Contents Demo
description: Demonstration page for testing the "On this page" table of contents with various heading structures.
---

This page demonstrates how different heading structures render in the right-side "On this page" table of contents. Use it to test TOC behavior with various nesting levels.

## Single Level Headings

This section contains only h2 headings to test flat TOC structure.

## Introduction to TOC

The table of contents automatically extracts headings from your content and displays them in a navigable sidebar.

## How It Works

Starlight scans your MDX content for heading elements and generates the TOC based on their hierarchy.

## Best Practices

Keep your heading structure consistent and logical for the best user experience.

## Double Nested Headings

This section demonstrates h2 headings with h3 children.
