## Long List Items

Lists where items contain multiple sentences or paragraphs of text:

1. This is the first item in the list. It contains multiple sentences to demonstrate how longer content wraps and flows within a list item. The styling should maintain readability.

2. This is the second item. It also has extended content to show the visual rhythm of the list when items vary in length.

3. Short item.

4. Another longer item that spans multiple lines to ensure consistent spacing and alignment throughout the list structure.
